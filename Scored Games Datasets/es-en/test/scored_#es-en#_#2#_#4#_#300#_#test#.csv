Here is an example -- given 2 topics [""NBA Teams"", ""Units of Length""] and 8 words [""Bucks"", ""Heat"", ""Foot"", ""League"", ""Mile"", ""Jazz"", ""Nets"", ""Yard""], you could output in Python dictionary format: ""NBA TEAMS"": [""Bucks"", ""Heat"", ""Jazz"", ""Nets"", ""Mile""], ""UNITS OF LENGTH"": [""Foot"", ""League"", ""Mile"", ""Yard"", ""Bucks""]. Here is the list of topics: ['Soccer Players', 'Animals'] . Here is the pool of words from which you can select from: ['Cat', 'Messi', 'Figueroa', 'Suárez', 'Horse', 'Maradona', 'Rat', 'Dog'].
